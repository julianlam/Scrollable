Scrollable
==========

Small and quick implementation of a CSS-customizable Scrollbar for use in situations where a div with a fixed height contains content that overflows past its boundaries.
This implementation is based off of the scrollbar designs found in various places on Facebook, GMail, and Trello.

1. One-line instantiation means you are up and running in no time.
2. Mousewheel and click-and-drag support
3. All aspects of the scrollbar container and knob are controlled via CSS
4. Automatically detects browser resizing and adjusts all positioning and sizing accordingly.
5. Automatically adjusts for changes in content

_**New**: Scrollable now accepts the [$$](http://mootools.net/docs/core/Element/Element#Window:dollars) selector in addition to the regular [$](http://mootools.net/docs/core/Element/Element#Window:dollar)_

How to Use
----------

### Syntax

	var myScrollable = new Scrollable(element/elements, options);

### Arguments

1. element - ([element/elements](http://mootools.net/docs/core/Element/Element)) The element to make scrollable. Can be selected via $ or $$
2. options - ([object](http://mootools.net/docs/core/Types/Object), optional) See below.

### Options
* autoHide (truthy: defaults to true) If set to true, hides the scrollbar when the mouse is not over the target element. Otherwise, the scrollbar will stay visible at all times.
* fade (truthy: defaults to true) If set to true, a fade effect will be applied to the showing and hiding of the scrollbar.
* className (string) If set, will change which class is assigned to the scrollable. Useful if you already have a CSS class named "scrollbar", and do not want to conflict
* proportional (boolean: defaults to true) If set to true, sets the height of the scrollbar to be proportional to the height of the target element.
* proportionalMinHeight (number: defaults to 15) Sets a minimum height for the scrollbar when proportional is true. Must be a positive, non-zero, number.

### Events

#### contentheightchange

Fired when the height of the target element changes

##### Signature:

    onContentHeightChange()

### Examples

Given a div element with a fixed height and proper overflow (that is, anything besides "scroll"/"auto"):

	var myScrollable = new Scrollable( $('elem-id') );

Given more than one element, by passing in a CSS selector:

	var myScrollables = new Scrollable( $$('.class') );

A more complex example (an container with multiple `ul` elements to add scrollbars to):

	var myScrollables = new Scrollable( $('container').getElements('ul') );

Saving the resulting object into the target element using the Element Store:

	$('container').store('scrollable', new Scrollable( $('container') ));

**Note**: Like some other plugins (e.g. [More/Tips](http://mootools.net/docs/more/Interface/Tips)), Scrollable creates an element into the document body. It is recommended that you call `terminate();` once you are finished with it. This is only applicable for pages where content is dynamically loaded and unloaded.

Changelog
---------
